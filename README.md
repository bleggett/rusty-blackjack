# This is me trying to learn Rust by doing a blackjack sim

Trying to avoid referencing specific examples and rely entirely on stuff hosted
at <https://doc.rust-lang.org>

Goal: Get to that [magic Zen
state](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.8.0/book/references-and-borrowing.html#meta)
where I'm able to think somewhat more intuitively about the borrow checker

Secondary Goal: Make all my dumb mistakes out in the open
